This was the official DASH website of D-A-S-H clothing online. The website was in the early stages of development at that time and probably not well attended to due to the major success of the nationally syndicated reality-TV series <em>"<strong><a href="http://www.dashboutiqueclothing.com/kardashians-dash-show/">Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a></strong>"</em> DASH was growing fast.</p>

<p>The website was temporarily put under construction in March of 2008 and inaccessible to the public until further notice. When relaunched in April of 2008, it was apparently not well received. The prices where high end and inventory listed was small. Very small. The DASH website at that time consisted of various brands of <a href="http://www.hotboutiqueclothing.com/" target="blank">Boutique Clothing</a> and Accessories. Many items on the DASH online website were over the $500 range.</p>

<p>The Era of Shop DASH Online was over by late summer of 2008 when the website "vanished" out of thin air. There were problems and other things were happening so, eventually a new online shop website will be unveiled for DASH.</p>
<h1 style="color: #ff204d;">There Is No Official DASH Website Online To Buy D-A-S-H Products</h1>

<p>Over three years and still no DASH shop online. When it does come back online, you can be sure it will be a BIG budget project with all the bells and whistles of a good online shop of today. In the mean time, and due to the popularity of the show; <a href="http://www.dashboutiqueclothing.com/k-dash/">K-DASH</a> is available through QVC.com and the Kardashians now have a line with Sears. They probably don't shop there, but you can find offshoots of the DASH clothing line there. Bebe is another company that has got into the Kardashian Klan. They have a small offering of clothing products in comparison to QVC or Sears. Ebay is always an option for those seeking DASH or one of there related lines of clothing, swimsuits, apparel, and fragrances. Until further notice, this website will remain listed as a DASH homepage for informational purposes only.</p>
