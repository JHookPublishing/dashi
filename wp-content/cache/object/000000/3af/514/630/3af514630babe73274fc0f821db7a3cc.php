<h1>Comment On DASH Los Angeles Below</h1>
<h1 style="font-size:77%";>*Also Known As DASH LA</h1>
<p>DASH Los Angeles was the Kardashians first Boutique and remains quite popular to this day.  The location has a modern decor with black colors throughout.  It is not overly busy at most times, but waves of tourists or Paparazzi (if someone famous is there) occasionally show up.  Much of the selection is modern-California-young-boutique.  The clothing price range is higher-end and offers women's apparel & accessories + California Casual T's, swimwear, sunglasses and other things California.</p>
<p>The Kardashians know California style having been raised there and DASH Los Angeles is stocked with a complete selection elegant and everyday apparel from popular brands such as Foley - Olivia - Moschino and many others.  This DASH Los Angeles boutique is more established being the original store and has acquired several more niche' boutique fashion designers and manufacturers over the past few years since their grand opening in 2006.</p>
<p>What you won't find at DASH Los Angeles, is the stuff you see on TV.  The K-Dash line is available through QVC only.  More recently, there has been a lot of exposure for the Kardashian Kollection in the media; however, this too is an exclusive line in affiliation with Sears.  DASH Los Angeles specializes in more hard to find fashions that they themselves would wear.</p>
