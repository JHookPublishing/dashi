Despite the glitz, most viewers are not focused on the material aspects of the story.Â  The things that come through are the freedom, family, and fun.Â  What is it? Some do ask.Â  This is a common question that I hear.Â  More so than not, it is good old things that people watch for.Â  A glimpse into what is possible in this country is always interesting and the Kardashians Show provides a wide array of that.

In spite of the movement to boycott "<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/16/boycott-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-online-petition-reality-show-off-air_n_1097165.html" target="blank"><em>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</em></a>" with 100,000+ signatures - To keep up with the Kardashian sisters can be tough. Kim &amp; Kourtney and Kloe are well received in New York. Following Kim's divorce to basketball guy Kris Whatever-His-Name-Is, several celebrities have shown public support for Kim. Rumors ran amuck that Kris publicly belittled Kim. Rumors are rumors, who knows? At any rate, it was good for ratings and apparently not a publicity stunt as some have reported. They truly grew to dislike each other, lol.

Of the 3<a title="Official DASH Stores" href="http://www.dashboutiqueclothing.com/dash-official-stores" target="_blank"> locations</a>Â of DASH Clothing Boutique most people like the original location in Calabasas, California. DASH styles are rooted in California Boutique fashion culture. Due to the popularity of the brand many are reporting that counterfeit goods are on the rise WATCH OUT! Only SEARS, QVC.com, and DASH stores (physical locations) are authorized distributors of DASH clothing.

On the tonight show, President Obama claimed that he has not seen an episode of <em>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</em>. After a collective sigh of relief from the viewing public, he was asked if he allows his daughters to watch the show? The answer was that he "thinks" his daughters have seen it.Â  Michelle Obama noted that whe like her daughters to learn moral lessons when watching TV. She implied that some of the show's crazy factor leaned toward being inappropriate for children.

Overall <em>Keeping Up With The Kardashians </em>reality show is a bit far from reality - for most.Â  DASH clothing line is however, very real.Â  The dream of freedom andÂ  family is still alive in the minds of many of the shows viewers.Â  Some may criticize the antics or excursiveness, but they are a tight knit family doing a lot of things that people aspire to do.Â  Hopefully if nothing else, it keeps the dream alive for many.Â  Even the haters will admit to a warm-fuzzy in the midst of a happy-family-funÂ  scene.Â  So Keep Up With The Kardashian crew this year and beyond.Â  <a title="New DASH Store - Melrose In LA" href="http://www.dashboutiqueclothing.com/2012/07/new-dash-store-in-la-melrose/">DASH Melrose in LA</a> is now open.Â  Check it out!

The showâ€™s finale is scheduled for <del>February, 2012.</del>  Keep Up With The Kardashian Crew at least for the remainder of 2012 and hopefully beyond.  

The promotion of the new and 4th location of DASH boutiques in Los Angeles, may be the cause for yet another televised season ofÂ  Keeping Up With The Kardashians.
