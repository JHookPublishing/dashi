<p>What is the DASH website?  This is one of the most common questions we hear.  The answer is two fold.  First off, you cannot find the exact items that are found at the D-A-S-H Boutique stores:  <a href="http://www.dashboutiqueclothing.com/dash-stores/dash-clothing-la/">DASH LA</a> - <a href="http://www.dashboutiqueclothing.com/dash-stores/dash-miami/">DASH Miami</a> - <a href="http://www.dashboutiqueclothing.com/dash-stores/dash-new-york/">DASH New York</a>.  That is where the confusion begins.</p>

<p>The official D-A-S-H ecommerce website was taken offline in 2009 for further development.  The official DASH website for purchasing D-A-S-H store items has NOT returned since.  Plans for a new website are most likely in-the-works.  People often ask why not DASH.com?  Unfortunatly for the Kardashians, DASH.com is the home of a very successful detergent company that is global and has a lot of money invested in that address.  This then left the Kardashians with ShopDashOnline.com - which is currently out of service. </p>
<p>Fans of DASH Boutique fashions that you see the Kardashian sisters on TV dealing with and wearing themselves are currently offline only.  A worthy alternative in the minds of D-A-S-H fans seems to be the new lines of <a href="http://www.dashboutiqueclothing.com/k-dash/">K DASH</a> and Kardashian Kollection.  K-DASH is availalble on QVC through the TV station when aired, or through QVC.com.  Kim Kardashian is often promoting it on QVC television network.  The Kardashian Kollection is avaialble through Sears and is available via Sears.com.  Sears is running some good holiday savings on these items with up to 30% off on certain Kardashian Kollection items.</p>

<h1>The Return Of Shop DASH Online</h1>
<p>If things continue to expand on the D-A-S-H Boutiques segment of the business, hopefully for the sake of DASH clothing fans, Shop DASH Online will reappear soon.  With the potential coming of <a href="http://www.dashboutiqueclothing.com/2011/12/dash-dallas-kardashians-may-dash-to-dallas/">DASH Dallas</a> and a final season of hit reality TV-Show "<em><a href="http://www.dashboutiqueclothing.com/keep-up-with-the-kardashian/">Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a></em>" the D-A-S-H brand is sure to receive another boost of exposure leading to more of a demand for a quality eCommerce site.  For the time being, we will just have to wait on updates for more DASH website information concerning Shop DASH Online.</p>
<p>It is not <em>the</em> DASH website, but it will do for now.</p>";s:10:"post_title";s:34:"DASH Website - Shop DASH Online ??";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:36:"dash-website-online-shop-dash-online";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:275:"http://www.dashboutiqueclothing.com/2011/12/dash-dallas-kardashians-may-dash-to-dallas/
