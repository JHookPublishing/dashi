<h1>Khloe Kardashian and PETA</h1>
<p>In 2010 Khloe Kardashian was selected as a public figure by the organization PETA to protest animal abuses in the fashion industry.  Khloe seemed to be a perfect fit for this agenda, as she is a heavily exposed person, is in the fashion industry with DASH, and shares the feelings that animals should not be meant to suffer unnecessarily for the sake of luxury. In perhaps her most risque public appearance she appeared nude, but covered for a PETA photo shoot and public awareness campaign.  Khloe Kardashian is also known for her role as Spokeswoman for <em><a href="http://gan.doubleclick.net/gan_click?lid=41000000001360343&pid=SPM1627207101&adurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sears.com%2Fshc%2Fs%2Fp_10153_12605_SPM1627207101P&usg=AFHzDLv3aMsbFDEwatROE70A-tEcMiyLlA&pubid=21000000000354800">Quick Trim</a></em> dietary supplement.</p>
